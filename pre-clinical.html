                        <li>Deliver teaching within a research-led environment.</li>
                        <li>Provide students with a broad background in modern anatomy.</li>
                        <li>Provide laboratory/practical training in aspects of Bio photonics and Imaging.</li>
                        <li>Encourage students to develop oral, written, numerical, visual, presentation and collaborative skills appropriate to a wide range of employment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The discipline of anatomy aims to maintain the importance of understanding the structure of the living body at the forefront of clinical medical, nursing and therapeutic practice, thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of patient care. Anatomy aims to promote horizontal and vertical integration of basic sciences, as well as integrate Anatomy with modern medical imaging, developing appropriate factual content relevant to each of the student groups that we teach.</p>


                    <h2>Objectives</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gross and Developmental Anatomy is a first-year course designed to provide students with a fundamental working knowledge of normal human gross and developmental anatomy as a basis for the practice of medicine.</li>
                        <li>To provide an opportunity for medical students who distinguish themselves in Human Anatomy undertake research-based training in Anatomy.</li>
                        <li>Provide laboratory/practical training in aspects of Bio photonics and Imaging.</li>
                        <li>To provide training as would enable them to sub-specialize in anatomy at an early stage of their career.</li>

                    <h2>Message from HOD</h2>
                    <p>It is a pleasure and honor to head the anatomy department at Trichy SRM Medical College. Our faculty work in an invigorating and friendly atmosphere. Our students gain exposure to traditional and current styles of learning anatomy. Our priorities lie in imparting sound anatomical knowledge that the student can call upon at any later point of professional practice and tune the critical thinking skills of the medical student. While we focus on scoring well in the examinations, what we really inculcate in the student is the habit of knowledge –seeking that will establish the lifelong learning habits necessary for a 21st century medical professional. We nurture research among both faculty and students and ensure that those interested have access to necessary guidance and infrastructure. It is my personal belief that forging the foundation of a competent and conscientious medical graduate lies with the Department of Anatomy when he first meets the cadaver, “the first patient”.</p>

                    <h2>Infrastructure of the Department</h2>
                    <p>Human body is a complex creation. It continues to baffle the medical professionals in spite of great many leaps in the field of therapeutic and diagnostic medicine. Therefore, the proper understanding of the basic structure of human body grossly, microscopically and developmentally forms the foundation stone of the medical curriculum. This extensive knowledge of structural aspects of human body is essential for future building up as the student climbs up the ladder of medical education.</p>
                    <p>The encouraging and challenging atmosphere of the anatomy department always creates a long lasting impact on the students and it reserves a special place in the minds of present and past students.</p>
                    <p>The department of anatomy that occupies the rear end of the college building occupying 2143 sq. area. It encompasses a dissection hall, cadaver preservation area, histology laboratory, research laboratory, demonstration rooms, seminar cum library room, faculty rooms, locker room and common room for students, burial ground and a museum.</p>
